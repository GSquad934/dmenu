# My build of DMenu v5.0

This repository hosts the source code of my build of dmenu (Dynamic menu for X) from the [Suckless software](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/). It is based on dmenu v5.0 and different patches have been applied in order to provide the features I liked.

**README WILL BE UPDATED LATER TODAY**
